# Nonlinear-Dynamical-System
As the motivation for developing advanced aircraft systems continues to grow, a significant demand exists for high-fidelity dynamics simulation platforms to accelerate the design cycles and lower the project cost. Current popular topics in the aerospace industry include but are not limited to Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM), which all require extensive simulation data to ensure the safe deployment of prototype flight tests. The initial step of implementing aircraft simulations is to build a dynamic model to incorporate aerodynamics from wind tunnel tests or computational methods. Nonetheless, aircraft is extraordinarily complex and highly nonlinear, in which the system may have finite escape time, non-unique solutions, and periodic orbits. Hence, it is critical to study and understand the aircraft system’s nonlinear behaviors before developing simulations.

The project aims to investigate the nonlinear effects of the aircraft using a six-DOF dynamic model. The system consists of nine coupled nonlinear differential equations describing the aircraft’s orientation and exerted forces. The nine states evolve with time and contain periodic cycles, stability issues, and solutions that are not defined for all time, making the model a nonlinear dynamical system.
